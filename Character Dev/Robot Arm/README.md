Robot Arm Design:
The purpose of this robot arm is to be used mainly for utility. Being attatched to a larger main body, it would be used for heavy labor and tasks that can be accomplished easier with this robot than with a team/group of workers. The larger forearm attatchment provides the strength in the grip of the robot with various joints along the arm for range and mobility. At the different joints, there are cylinders on hinges that provide for free movement with a sphere at the shoulder to allow a wide range of motion.

Instead of acting as if the arm would attatch to a larger body, for this specific purpose, it will be attached to some sort of platform/surface with a ring that has clamps around the perimeter.

It didn't seem like there were any HUGE challenges I ran into. I wanted to make sure that the arm had a proper "machine" aesthetic, so I beveled many of the hard edges to soften them up just enough to still achieve the effect I wanted. Making use of the extrude tool also helped a lot in the design for the area in which the sphere is placed for the overall mobility of the arm.
