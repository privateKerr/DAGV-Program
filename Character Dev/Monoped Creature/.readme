I took most of my inspiration from whales. I like their overall shape, and I thought it would be cool to mix it with some sort of mythical creature, so naturally my mind went to a dragon!
I wanted a sleeker design to the creature, so the horns are pretty simple and the body shape is fairly rounded. On the sides of the head are tube like horn protrusions, and along the back
there is a dorsal fin. I wanted it to "feel" aquatic in the design, and I feel like I achieved that.
